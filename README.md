# Codename One Skin Designer

The Skin Designer is a Codename One app that allows you to visually design a Codename One "skin" representing a device type from two images and a bit of device specific details. This application serves both as a demo for working with Codename One and as a real tool that can be used to create device skins.

This tool was mostly designed for use in the web via the JavaScript port of Codename One, but it can also work thru the desktop port.
