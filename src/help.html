        <h1>Skin Designer Help</h1>
        <p>The skin designer tool allows you to visually design and save a Codename One skin file that you can
        use to simulate a custom device type. To use this tool you need two pictures of the device in portrait
        and landscape mode. The screen area of these pictures must match the device screen size!</p>
        
        <p>
            <b>TIP:</b> To find files like that just search for the name of the device you are looking for followed by
            "mockup". This will bring up device mockups you can often use. FYI be sure to read the license of the 
            graphic you use if you intend to publish this, many creators require attribution!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Creating a Skin</h2>
        <p>
            You will need to select the device image in portrait/landscape, you can then enter the screen dimensions
            in pixels that should match the area within the graphic. <br />
            You can enter the X/Y position or use the hand "pan tool" to visually position the screen within the graphic.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process should be repeated both for portrait and landscape images respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            You then need to enter a set of values to indicate details about the skin as described below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Native Theme</b> - the underlying native theme of the device, e.g. iOS devices use an iOS 7+ native theme</li>
            <li><b>Platform name</b> - This affects the <a href="https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/ui/Display.html">Display</a> 
                platform name</li>
            <li><b>Tablet</b> - this indicates if the <code>isTablet()</code> method will return true or false</li>
            <li><b>System Font Family</b> - the default builtin font family. Notice that this only applies to system fonts and not to native fonts</li>
            <li><b>Proportional Font Family</b> - the proportional builtin font family. Notice that this only applies to system fonts and not to native fonts</li>
            <li><b>Monospace Font Family</b> - the monospace font family. Notice that this only applies to system fonts and not to native fonts</li>
            <li><b>Small font size</b> - when you pick "small" for the font size this is the size it will have in pixels</li>
            <li><b>Medium font size</b> - when you pick "medium" for the font size this is the size it will have in pixels</li>
            <li><b>Large font size</b> - when you pick "large" for the font size this is the size it will have in pixels</li>
            <li><b>Pixel Ratio</b> - the number of pixels per <b>millimeter</b> on the device. To convert a PPI (pixels per inch) 
                value to millimeters just divide the value by <code>25.4</code>. <br />
                E.g. a device with 264 ppi will have <code>264 / 25.4 = 10.3937008</code> pixels per millimeter</li>
            <li><b>Platform overrides</b> - These represent the theme override behavior which you can use
            to override platform specific behavior on the device</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Saving &amp; Testing</h3>
        
        <p>
            You can save the skin by pressing the save button on the top right. In the desktop version it will reside in
            the <code>.SkinDesigner</code> directory in your home folder. In the web version you will be prompted
            to save the skin file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rename the file to a name the represents the device and test it in the simulator by pressing the "Add" button
            in the skins menu.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Submitting the Skin</h2>
        <p>
            Assuming your skin file doesn't violate any copyrights we'd appreciate if you submit it to our official skin 
            repository!<br />
            If your skin file requires attribution please include that within the skin image...
        </p>
        <p>
            Start by navigating to <a  href="https://github.com/codenameone/codenameone-skins">github.com/codenameone/codenameone-skins</a>
            &amp; fork the project. Drag your skin file into the OTA directory. Create a 112x112 icon png file for the skin
            and drag it into that directory as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next select the <code>Skins.xml</code> file and edit it. Add your skin in a similar way to the other skin files
            and commit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now click the submit pull request button to submit these changes for inclusion in the main repository.
        </p>
